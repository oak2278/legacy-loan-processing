### Added

#### Database Layer
- Complete database schema with 5 tables (Customers, LoanApplications, LoanDecisions, PaymentSchedules, InterestRates)
- 9 stored procedures implementing core business logic:
  - `sp_CreateCustomer` - Customer creation with validation
  - `sp_UpdateCustomer` - Customer information updates
  - `sp_GetCustomerById` - Customer retrieval
  - `sp_SearchCustomers` - Customer search functionality
  - `sp_SubmitLoanApplication` - Loan application submission
  - `sp_EvaluateCredit` - Credit evaluation and risk scoring
  - `sp_ProcessLoanDecision` - Loan approval/rejection processing
  - `sp_CalculatePaymentSchedule` - Amortization schedule generation
  - `sp_GeneratePortfolioReport` - Portfolio analytics and reporting
- Database indexes for performance optimization
- Sample data initialization script with 13 customers, 60 interest rates, and 14 loan applications

#### Application Layer
- Domain models (Customer, LoanApplication, LoanDecision, PaymentSchedule, InterestRate)
- Entity Framework 6.4.4 DbContext configuration
- Repository layer with ADO.NET for stored procedure calls
- Service layer with business logic and error handling
- Dependency injection setup

#### Web Layer
- ASP.NET MVC 5 controllers:
  - CustomerController - Customer management
  - LoanController - Loan application processing
  - ReportController - Portfolio reporting
  - InterestRateController - Interest rate management
- Razor views with Bootstrap 3 styling:
  - Customer views (Index, Details, Create, Edit)
  - Loan views (Index, Details, Apply, Evaluate, Decide, Schedule)
  - Report views (Portfolio with filtering)
  - Interest rate views (Index, Create, Edit)
- Shared layout with navigation and messaging
- Client-side jQuery validation for all forms

#### Testing Infrastructure
- FSCheck 2.16.6 for property-based testing
- PropertyTestGenerators for domain models
- PropertyTestBase with 100-iteration configuration
- 7 sample property tests demonstrating setup
- Test scripts for controller validation

#### Documentation
- README.md with project overview and 6-phase modernization roadmap
- DEPLOYMENT.md - Comprehensive deployment guide (500+ lines)
- DATABASE_SETUP.md - Database setup and maintenance (400+ lines)
- APPLICATION_CONFIGURATION.md - Configuration reference (450+ lines)
- CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution guidelines
- CHANGELOG.md - This file
- Component-specific documentation for database and testing

### Technical Details

#### Technology Stack
- .NET Framework 4.7.2
- ASP.NET MVC 5.2.7
- Entity Framework 6.4.4
- SQL Server 2016+ (or LocalDB)
- Bootstrap 3.4.1
- jQuery 3.7.1
- FSCheck 2.16.6

#### Architecture Patterns
- Layered architecture (Presentation → Service → Repository → Database)
- Repository pattern with ADO.NET
- Stored procedures for business logic (legacy pattern)
- Manual parameter mapping and result set handling
- Limited dependency injection

#### Business Features
- Customer management with credit score tracking
- Loan application submission with validation
- Automated credit evaluation and risk scoring
- Loan decision processing with approval workflow
- Payment schedule generation with amortization
- Portfolio reporting with filtering
- Interest rate management by loan type and credit tier

#### Loan Types Supported
- Personal loans (up to $50,000)
- Auto loans (up to $75,000)
- Mortgage loans (up to $500,000)
- Business loans (up to $250,000)

#### Credit Score Tiers
- Excellent: 750-850
- Good: 700-749
- Fair: 650-699
- Poor: 600-649
- Bad: 300-599

### Known Limitations

#### By Design (Legacy Patterns)
- Business logic in stored procedures (not in application tier)
- Tight coupling to SQL Server
- Limited unit test coverage due to database dependencies
- Manual ADO.NET data access (no ORM for business operations)
- No authentication/authorization framework
- No API layer

#### Optional Features Not Implemented
- Property-based tests for all 20 correctness properties (infrastructure ready)
- Comprehensive unit test suite (basic tests included)
- Advanced reporting features
- Audit logging
- Email notifications
- Document management

### Security Notes
- Connection strings should be encrypted in production
- SSL/TLS should be enabled for production deployments
- Database user permissions should follow principle of least privilege
- Input validation implemented at multiple layers
- SQL injection prevented through parameterized queries

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexes created for common query patterns
- Stored procedures are pre-compiled for performance
- Output caching configured for static content
- Compression enabled for HTTP responses

### Deployment Requirements
- Windows Server 2016+ or Windows 10/11
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher
- SQL Server 2016+ or LocalDB
- IIS 8.5+ (for production)
- Minimum 4GB RAM, 10GB disk space

### Migration Path
See [workshop modules](workshop/) for guided modernization exercises.
